# Contract Registry Pallet

This pallet was designed to allow users to create text contracts that contain parties. These contracts may be signed by parties as well as by judges. 

## Overview
Any user can create a contract and add some parties to it. These parties may sign the given contract to 'make it valid' and prevent it from removal. 

The contract may be also signed by a judge to make it 'valid' in front of Liberland law.
