# Liberland Merit(LLM) Pallet

## Overview

Liberland Merit is a Liberland currency that gives political power to citizens.

The LLM pallet handles:

* creating LLM asset in `pallet-assets` on genesis
* LLM release from **Vault** to **Treasury**
* locking, a.k.a. politipooling the LLM for use in politics
* veryfing citizenship status

## LLM lifecycle

On Genesis (see `fn create_llm`):

* LLM is created in `pallet-assets`
* configured `TotalSupply` amount of LLM is created and transferred to **Vault**
* configured `PreReleasedAmount` is transferred from **Vault** to **Treasury**

On yearly basis (see `fn try_release`):

* 90% of **Vault** balance is transferred to **Treasury**

Accounts are free to locks in politics, a.k.a. politipool any amount of LLM at any time.

Accounts may unlock 10% of locked LLM once every `Withdrawlock` duration (see [Genesis Config](#genesis-config)), but it will suspend their politics rights for `Electionlock` duration.

Accounts may freely transfer their not-locked LLM to other accounts.

### Special accounts:

* **Treasury**:
    * gets `PreReleasedAmount` LLM on genesis and 10% of **Vault** balance periodically (_LLM Release Event_)
    * derived from PalletID `lltreasu`: `5EYCAe5hveooUENA5d7dwq3caqM4LLBzktNumMKmhNRXu4JE`

* **Vault**:
    * gets initial supply of LLM on genesis
    * releases 10% of it's balance to **Trasury** on LLM Release Event (yearly)
    * derived from PalletID `llm/safe`: `5EYCAe5hvejUE1BUTDSnxDfCqVkADRicSKqbcJrduV1KCDmk`

* **Politipool**,
    * gets LLM locked in politics by other accounts (`politics_lock`)
    * releases locked LLM back on `politics_unlock`
    * derived from PalletID `politilock`: `5EYCAe5ijGqt3WEM9aKUBdth51NEBNz9P84NaUMWZazzWt7c`
