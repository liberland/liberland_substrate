//! # Liberland Federated Bridge Pallet
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Federated Bridge Pallet is a part of Substrate <-> ETH bridge designed for
//! bridging LLM and LLD tokens to Ethereum network.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! * Bridge - complete system for transferring LLD/LLM to/from ETH, consisting of the bridge
//!   pallet, relays, watchers and bridge contract.
//! * Bridge pallet - part of Substrate chain - handles locking and unlocking
//! * Bridge contract - contract deployed on ETH - handles minting and burning
//! * Mint/burn - create/destroy wrapped token on ETH side
//! * Lock/unlock - lock LLD/LLM on substrate side while it's wrapped in tokens on ETH side.
//! * Stop - state in which bridge stops all actions
//! * Federation - set of relays, capable of minting and unlocking.
//! * Relay - offchain software that monitors locks on substrate and burns on eth and relays them to
//!   the other chain
//! * Watcher - monitors if relays don't misbehave - has right to stop bridge at any time
//! * Admin - someone with rights to stop/resume bridge
//! * Superadmin - account with rights to add/remove relay rights
//!
//! ## Bridge configuration
//!
//! ### Option 1: genesis / chainspec
//!
//! If you're starting a new chain, preconfigure the bridge using chain spec.
//! See the GenesisConfig struct for details.
//!
//! ### Option 2: using ForceOrigin
//!
//! If you're chain is running, but you have some trusted chain authority (like sudo key):
//! * set the ForceOrigin in runtime config
//! * using ForceOrigin call `set_admin` and `set_super_admin`
//! * using SuperAdmin call `add_relay` for all your relays
//! * using SuperAdmin call `set_votes_required`
//! * using SuperAdmin or Admin call `add_watcher` for all your watchers
//! * using SuperAdmin or Admin call `set_fee`
//! * using SuperAdmin or Admin call `set_state(Active)`
//!
//! ### Option 3: migration
//!
//! Write migration that will run on Runtime Upgrade that set everythin you
//! need. See GenesisBuild implementation for example.
//!
//! ## Typical ETH -> Substrate transfer flow
//!
//! 1. User deposits wrapped tokens to eth contract, a Receipt is issued as an event
//! 2. Relays see the Receipt event and relay it to bridge using `vote_withdraw` call
//! 3. User waits until `VotesRequired` votes are cast
//! 4. User calls `withdraw` on the bridge.
//!
//! ## Typical Substrate -> ETH transfer flow
//!
//! 1. User deposits native LLM/LLD to to Bridge pallet using `deposit` call, a
//!    Receipt is issued as an event
//! 2. Relays see the Receipt event and relay it to Ethereum contract
//! 3. User waits until required number of votes are cast by relays on Ethereum side
//! 4. User calls `withdraw` on the etherum side.
//!
//! ## Economics
//!
//! Running relays requires paying for resource use (CPU, storage, network) and
//! both Substrate and Ethereum network fees. As such, they're rewarded on each
//! successful withdrawal by user.
//!
//! The fee charged to user on withdrawal is set with `set_fee` call and can be
//! queried from pallet's storage.
//!
//! This fee is divided equally between relays that actually cast vote on given
//! transfer.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! Following security features are implemented substrate-side:
//! * bridge is stopped if 2 relays claim different details about given Receipt (different amount,
//!   recipient etc)
//! * bridge can be stopped by a watcher at any time
//! * bridge doesn't mint any new funds - only funds stored in bridge (a.k.a. existing as wrapped
//!   tokens on Eth side) are at risk
//! * bridge enforces rate-limit on withdrawals
//! * bridge enforces minimum transfer amount
//! * bridge limits how many tokens can be locked (bridged) at the same time
//! * there's a delay between approval of withdrawal and actually allowing it
//!
//! ## Pallet Config
//!
//! * `Currency` - Currency in which Fee will be charged (should be the same as curreny of fees for
//!   extrinsics)
//! * `Token` - fungible implementing Transfer trait that is bridged between networks
//! * `PalletId` - used to derive AccountId for bridge wallet
//! * `MaxRelays`
//! * `MaxWatchers`
//! * `MaxTotalLocked` - maximum amount of tokens that can be stored in bridges wallet. Deposits
//!   will start failing after this is reached.
//! * `WithdrawalDelay` - number of blocks between transfer approval and actually allowing it
//! * `WithdrawalRateLimit` - rate limit parameters
//! * `MinimumTransfer` - minimum amount that can be deposited in single call
//! * `MinimumFee` - minimum fee that can be set by admin
//! * `MaximumFee` - maximum fee that can be set by admin
//! * `ForceOrigin` - origin that's authorized to set admin and super admin
//!
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! * `deposit`: Entrypoint for starting substrate -> eth transfer
//! * `vote_withdraw`: Call for relays to vote on approving eth -> substrate transfers
//! * `withdraw`: Call for users to finish approved eth -> substrate transfer
//! * `set_fee`: Set withdrawal fee
//! * `set_votes_required`: Set number of votes required to approve eth -> substrate transfer
//! * `add_relay`: Adds new relay
//! * `remove_relay`: Removes relay
//! * `add_watcher`: Adds new watcher
//! * `remove_watcher`: Removes watcher
//! * `set_state`: Allows stopping/resuming bridge
//! * `emergency_stop`: Call for Watchers to stop bridge in case of detected abuse
//! * `set_admin`: Sets new admin
//! * `set_super_admin`: Sets new super admin
//!
